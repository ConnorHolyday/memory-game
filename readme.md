# Memory Game

This is a small side-project to get a better understanding of a bunch of technologies.

Itâ€™s built using WebPack and Babel for ES6 support.

I've uploaded a demo [here](http://bureauprojects.co/avatars/)

__NOTE:__ I did have alternative versions in Node and PHP that took the images dynamically from a directory, or allowed you to drop them in. Going to have to remake that at some point...
